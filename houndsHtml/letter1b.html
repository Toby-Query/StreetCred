      <p class="paragraph">
        Can't believe you did it, you beat Death, just like your brother before
        you.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The long standing tradition is that death brings us a leader, every
        person who's ever led the hounds got in because they were trying to get
        a body out. Bryan led it when he was getting the body of the man who
        took care of him when Mrs Williams met her end.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        It then follows that you, trying to get Bryan's body, was just the hound
        gods giving us a new leader. Now all the hounds bow to you. We are
        yours.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        With regards to your brother, the car accident didn't leave much, it was
        so destructive that no body was left to bury, everything was in pieces.
        I am sorry. He was our brother too. In your brother's words: "Live fast,
        die sooner, that's what a racer is". He left the world doing what he
        loves.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        However, he did predict you'll one day come to lead the hounds, and he
        left a tape for you.
