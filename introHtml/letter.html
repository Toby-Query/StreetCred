        I don’t know how to say this in a way that won’t shatter your heart, but
        Bryan… he’s gone. The last race, the one he promised would be his final,
        ended in a crash. He collided with Austin Daniels, the politician, and
        neither of them survived. I’m so sorry, Dax. I know what he meant to
        you, and to me, it'll never be the same.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Track Hounds won’t give him back to us. It’s their twisted
        tradition—Bryan’s body belongs to them unless… unless you come back,
        unless you challenge them. I know you swore you’d never return to this
        life, the racing world you left behind to focus on your future. Bryan
        worked so hard to make sure you could chase your dreams, to fund your
        studies. And now, with him gone… there’s no one left to carry that
        weight.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I hate asking you this, but you’re the only one who can bring him home.
        If you race them—every single one of those so-called "brothers" of
        his—they’ll give him back. I wish there was another way, but this is how
        it’s always been with the Track Hounds. ”A hound buries a hound.”
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I know you’re not a part of their world anymore, but for Bryan’s
        sake—for everything he did for you, for blood—you’re the only one who
        can do this.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I’ll be here, waiting. You’re not alone in this. Please come back, Dax,
        and do what you have to. Bring him home.
      </p>
